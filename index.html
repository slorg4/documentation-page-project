                        Lua is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. 
                        It supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional 
                        programming, data-driven programming, and data description.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs 
                        based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, 
                        runs by interpreting bytecode with a register-based virtual machine, and has 
                        automatic memory management with a generational garbage collection, making it ideal 
                        for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lua is implemented as a library, written in clean C, the common subset of Standard C 
                        and C++. The Lua distribution includes a host program called lua, which uses the Lua 
                        library to offer a complete, standalone Lua interpreter, for interactive or batch use. Lua is intended to be used both as a powerful, lightweight, embeddable scripting language for any program that needs one, and as a powerful but lightweight and efficient stand-alone language.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As an extension language, Lua has no notion of a "main" program: it works embedded in 
                        a host client, called the embedding program or simply the host. (Frequently, this 
                        host is the stand-alone lua program.) The host program can invoke functions to 
                        execute a piece of Lua code, can write and read Lua variables, and can register C 
                        functions to be called by Lua code. Through the use of C functions, Lua can be 
                        augmented to cope with a wide range of different domains, thus creating customized 
                        programming languages sharing a syntactical framework.

                    <p>
                        Lua is a dynamically typed language. This means that variables do not have types; 
                        only values do. There are no type definitions in the language. All values carry their 
                        own type.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All values in Lua are first-class values. This means that all values can be stored in 
                        variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are eight basic types in Lua: nil, boolean, number, string, function, userdata, 
                        thread, and table. The type nil has one single value, nil, whose main property is to 
                        be different from any other value; it often represents the absence of a useful value. 
                        The type boolean has two values, false and true. Both nil and false make a condition 
                        false; they are collectively called false values. Any other value makes a condition 
                        true.

                    <p>
                        Lua is a free-form language. It ignores spaces and comments between lexical elements 
                        (tokens), except as delimiters between two tokens. In source code, Lua recognizes as 
                        spaces the standard ASCII whitespace characters space, form feed, newline, carriage 
                        return, horizontal tab, and vertical tab.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Names (also called identifiers) in Lua can be any string of Latin letters, 
                        Arabic-Indic digits, and underscores, not beginning with a digit and not being a 
                        reserved word. Identifiers are used to name variables, table fields, and labels.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The following keywords are reserved and cannot be used as names:

                    <p>
                        Lua is a case-sensitive language: and is a reserved word, but And and AND are two 
                        different, valid names. As a convention, programs should avoid creating names that 
                        start with an underscore followed by one or more uppercase letters (such as _VERSION).

                    <p>
                        Lua supports the following arithmetic operators:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="container-list">
                        <li>+: addition</li>
                        <li>-: subtraction</li>
                        <li>*: multiplication</li>
                        <li>/: float division</li>
                        <li>//: floor division</li>
                        <li>%: modulo</li>
                        <li>^: exponentiation</li>
                        <li>-: unary minus</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        With the exception of exponentiation and float division, the arithmetic operators 
                        work as follows: If both operands are integers, the operation is performed over 
                        integers and the result is an integer. Otherwise, if both operands are numbers, 
                        then they are converted to floats, the operation is performed following the machine's 
                        rules for floating-point arithmetic (usually the IEEE 754 standard), and the result 
                        is a float.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Exponentiation and float division (/) always convert their operands to floats and 
                        the result is always a float. Exponentiation uses the ISO C function pow, so that 
                        it works for non-integer exponents too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Floor division (//) is a division that rounds the quotient towards minus infinity, 
                        resulting in the floor of the division of its operands.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Modulo is defined as the remainder of a division that rounds the quotient towards 
                        minus infinity (floor division).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In case of overflows in integer arithmetic, all operations wrap around.

                    <p>
                        Lua supports the following bitwise operators:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="container-list">
                        <li>&: bitwise AND</li>
                        <li>|: bitwise OR</li>
                        <li>~: bitwise exclusive OR</li>
                        <li>>>: right shift</li>
                        <li><<: left shift</li>
                        <li>~: unary bitwise NOT</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        All bitwise operations convert its operands to integers (see §3.4.3), 
                        operate on all bits of those integers, and result in an integer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Both right and left shifts fill the vacant bits with zeros. Negative displacements 
                        shift to the other direction; displacements with absolute values equal to or higher 
                        than the number of bits in an integer result in zero (as all bits are shifted out).

                    <p>
                        Lua supports the following relational operators:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="container-list">
                        <li>==: equality</li>
                        <li>~=: inequality</li>
                        <li><: less than</li>
                        <li>>: greater than</li>
                        <li><=: less or equal</li>
                        <li>>=: greater or equal</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        These operators always result in false or true.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Equality (==) first compares the type of its operands. If the types are different, 
                        then the result is false. Otherwise, the values of the operands are compared. Strings 
                        are equal if they have the same byte content. Numbers are equal if they denote the 
                        same mathematical value.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tables, userdata, and threads are compared by reference: two objects are considered 
                        equal only if they are the same object. Every time you create a new object (a table, 
                        a userdata, or a thread), this new object is different from any previously existing 
                        object. A function is always equal to itself. Functions with any detectable 
                        difference (different behavior, different definition) are always different. 
                        Functions created at different times but with no detectable differences may be 
                        classified as equal or not (depending on internal caching details).

                        You can change the way that Lua compares tables and userdata by using the __eq 
                        metamethod.

                    <p>
                        Equality comparisons do not convert strings to numbers or vice versa. Thus, 
                        "0"==0 evaluates to false, and t[0] and t["0"] denote different entries in a table.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The operator ~= is exactly the negation of equality (==).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The order operators work as follows. If both arguments are numbers, then they are 
                        compared according to their mathematical values, regardless of their subtypes. 
                        Otherwise, if both arguments are strings, then their values are compared according 
                        to the current locale. Otherwise, Lua tries to call the __lt or the __le metamethod. 
                        A comparison a > b is translated to b < a and a >= b is translated to b <= a.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Following the IEEE 754 standard, the special value NaN is considered neither less 
                        than, nor equal to, nor greater than any value, including itself.

                        The logical operators in Lua are and, or, and not. Like the control structures, 
                        all logical operators consider both false and nil as false and anything else as true.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The negation operator not always returns false or true. The conjunction operator and 
                        returns its first argument if this value is false or nil; otherwise, and returns its 
                        second argument. The disjunction operator or returns its first argument if this value 
                        is different from nil and false; otherwise, or returns its second argument. Both and 
                        and or use short-circuit evaluation; that is, the second operand is evaluated only if 
                        necessary. Here are some examples:

                    <p>
                        Variables are places that store values. There are three kinds of variables in Lua: 
                        global variables, local variables, and table fields.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A single name can denote a global variable or a local variable (or a function's 
                        formal parameter, which is a particular kind of local variable):
                    </p>
                    <div class="container-code">
                        <code>var ::= Name</code>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Any variable name is assumed to be global unless explicitly declared as a local. 
                        Local variables are lexically scoped: local variables can be freely accessed by 
                        functions defined inside their scope.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before the first assignment to a variable, its value is nil.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Square brackets are used to index a table:
                    </p>
                    <div class="container-code">
                        <code>var ::= prefixexp '[' exp ']'</code>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The meaning of accesses to table fields can be changed via metatables.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The syntax var.Name is just syntactic sugar for var["Name"]:
                    </p>
                    <div class="container-code">
                        <code>var ::= prefixexp '.' Name</code>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        An access to a global variable x is equivalent to _ENV.x. Due to the way that chunks 
                        are compiled, the variable _ENV itself is never global.
